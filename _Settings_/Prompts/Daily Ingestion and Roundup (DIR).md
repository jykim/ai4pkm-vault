## Overview
Daily contents are ingested and processed into daily roundup, which is essentially episodic memory for my PKM.

### Process
1. [[_Settings_/Prompts/Enrich Ingested Content (EIC)]]
	- Ingested from [Readwise Reader](https://read.readwise.io/new) and [Obsidian Web Clipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper)
2. [[Generate Daily Roundup (GDR)]]
	- Augment to episodic knowledge
3. [[Topic Index Update (TIU)]]
	- Augment to semantic knowledge

### Guidelines
- `DIR` can be run multiple times per day, in which case only updated contents will be added to existing notes
